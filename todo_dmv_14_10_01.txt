TKDD To Do:

0) Decide on final file for code
*DONE* 1) Add in results from generalized additive logistic model;
  consider using the bam() function for large datasets
2) Add in results from weighted k-nearest neighbors
3) General literature search of machine learning in censored data
    a) General solutions
    b) Citations where discarding or zero were used 
      (Note: we have these for Bayes Netwrork but not other methods)
*DONE* 4) Literature search for CART and applications to censored data and/or medical applications
5) Literature search for generalized additive models
6) Literature search for k-nearest neighbors
6) Track down miscellaneous references
*DONE* 7) Write discussion
*DONE* 8) Implement other pre-processing techniques 
    a) Dividing censored observations into two with weights determined by marginal survival  
        (Stajduhar and Dalbelo-Basic 2010)
    b) Weighting by linearly scaled null residual (Zupan et al.) 
    c) Likelihood based approach (Stajduhar and Dalbelo-Basic 2012)
*DONE* 9) Update table 1, Figure 1, and numbers for the cohort used in this analysis
10) Include censoring aware versus censoring unaware graphics
11) Update Bayesian network graphics
12) Decide how to incorporate Cox model results
13) Check event description
14) Tuning methods 
    *DONE* a) CART
    *DONE* b) Bayesian network
    c) kNN
15) Implement Bayesian networks in R
