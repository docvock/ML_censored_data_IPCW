TKDD To Do:

0) Decide on final file for code
3) General literature search of machine learning in censored data
    a) General solutions
    b) Citations where discarding or zero were used 
      (Note: we have these for Bayes Netwrork but not other methods)
5) Literature search for generalized additive models
6) Literature search for k-nearest neighbors
6) Track down miscellaneous references
10) Include censoring aware versus censoring unaware graphics
13) Check event description
16) Cover Letter

*DONE* 1) Add in results from generalized additive logistic model;
  consider using the bam() function for large datasets
*DONE* 2) Add in results from weighted k-nearest neighbors
*DONE* 4) Literature search for CART and applications to censored data and/or medical applications
*DONE* 7) Write discussion
*DONE* 8) Implement other pre-processing techniques 
    *DONE* a) Dividing censored observations into two with weights determined by marginal survival  
        (Stajduhar and Dalbelo-Basic 2010)
    *IGNORE* b) Weighting by linearly scaled null residual (Zupan et al.) 
    *IGNORE* c) Likelihood based approach (Stajduhar and Dalbelo-Basic 2012)
*DONE* 9) Update table 1, Figure 1, and numbers for the cohort used in this analysis
*DONE* 11) Update Bayesian network graphics
*DONE* 12) Decide how to incorporate Cox model results
*DONE* 14) Tuning methods 
    *DONE* a) CART
    *DONE* b) Bayesian network
    *DONE* c) kNN
*DONE* 15) Implement Bayesian networks in R
